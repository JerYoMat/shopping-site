/*Function components and classes that extend Component are not pure. They will always re-render, even if their props havenâ€™t changed. If a class extends PureComponent instead, though, it is pure and it will skip re-rendering when its props are unchanged. Avoiding needless re-renders is the easiest way to improve performance in a React app.
